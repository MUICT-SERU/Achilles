# V-Achilles
## Prioritizing Vulnerable Dependency Updates through Dependency Graphs
V-Achilles is a tool that shows a visualization (i.e., using dependency graphs) of both direct and indirect dependencies that are affected by software vulnerabilityattacks. 

## Demo Website
The working prototype of V-Achilles can be found here: [https://achillestool.com/](https://achillestool.com/)

## Video Demo
The demo video on how V-Achilles works can be found here: [https://youtu.be/tspiZfhMNcs](https://youtu.be/tspiZfhMNcs)
